OpenStack-Folsom-VM-SandBox-Guide
=================================

 This Guide is for Stackers who want to Sand Box OpenStack Folsom in Virtual Box or Vmware.
 
* A short Decription:
 
  * [VMware] (https://www.vmware.com/) is one of the virtualization softwares which will provide a simple UI for the same. Its closed source and you will have to buy it. It is a bit more user-friendly than Virtual Box but it comes with a cost. 
   
  * [Virtual Box] (https://www.virtualbox.org/) is OpenSource virtualization software which is a bit noob-proof and agrees more with Geeks. But it supports more options and provides an API for managing, controlling Virtual Machines and other related settings.
